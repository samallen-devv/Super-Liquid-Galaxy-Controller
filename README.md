## Building from source

#### Prerequisites:

* Android Studio, Visual Studio Code or another IDE that supports Flutter development
* Flutter SDK
* Android SDK
* Android tablet device or emulator
* Git

Documentation on how to set up Flutter SDK and its environment can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) installed in your machine before proceeding.

#### Steps:

* Clone the repository via the following terminal command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/Super-Liquid-Galaxy-Controller.git
$ cd Super-Liquid-Galaxy-Controller
```

* After you have successfully cloned the project, set up Google maps API Key as Super Liquid Galaxy Controller uses [Google maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview?hl=pt-br) as the map service. To use Google maps you required an **API KEY**. To get this key you need to:

1. Have a Google Account
2. Create a Google Cloud Project
3. Open Google Cloud Console
4. Enable Maps Android SDK
5. Generate an API KEY

With the key in hands, the next step is placing the key inside the app. Go to *android/app/main* and edit the **AndroidManifest.xml**.

Replace the **PLACE_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY** with the key you just created.

```XML
<application
        android:label="Super Liquid Galaxy Controller"
        android:name="${applicationName}"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="PLACE_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```  

* To run the code, open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory. First you need to install the packages by running:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

* Now we check if our devices are connected and if all the environment is correct by the following terminal command:

```bash
$ flutter doctor
```

*  After this, we run our app by using the following command:

> ❗ Remember that you must have a tablet device connected or an android tablet emulator running in order to run the app.

```bash
$ flutter run
```

* To build the APK, use the following terminal command:

```bash
$ flutter build apk
```

> ⓘ  Once done, the APK file may be found into the `/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory, named `app-release.apk`.

* Finally setup the connection with the Liquid Galaxy in the same way as we did previously.

## Setting up the rig

* The Liquid Galaxy rig while not necessary to operate the Application; is a very essential component to access a lot of features of the Application.
* The Liquid Galaxy system is very simple to setup and extremely well-documented steps can be found here : [Documentation](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2024/05/lg-wiki.html#content-wrapper).
* The Documentation tab gives unparalleled insight into the various ways one can use an LG rig.

## End-Credits

We hope you have fun using this application ❤️
